## R for Progressive Campaigns

This repository contains R markdown documents demonstrating how to use R to solve /improve some common problems in progressive campaigns.

This is all in an effort to enable campaigns to be more data driven and use modern tooling. Enabling data directors and data managers to automate much of their job will allow them to spend more time on the complex problems that they face on a daily basis. Hell, they might even be able to go knock on some doors ;) 

This may or may not evolve into a more longform piece via bookdown. It's all TBD.
